# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This project is a digital recreation of the classic Snake game from old Nokia phones, implemented using Visual Basic and .NET for Windows. Control a snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body. The snake can move through walls and reappear on the opposite side, just like the original game.

## Key Features

- Classic arcade gameplay reminiscent of old Nokia phones
